This is a bricks breaker game, I used Intel Assembly to build this game. To compile and run it on Dosbox
Use commands TASM bricks,
              Tlink bricks util_br,
              bricks
User can press 1 or 2 affter reaching 50 points, once per game, that can entend the paddle and shoot a laser out of the paddle repectively.

Description:

Developed a Brick Breaker game using x86 Assembly language, demonstrating an advanced understanding of low-level programming and computer architecture.
Implemented game logic including ball movement, collision detection, and paddle control, enhancing game interactivity and user experience.
Designed a robust collision detection algorithm that calculates and responds to collisions between the ball and game objects (paddle and walls) efficiently, ensuring fluid gameplay.
Utilized direct memory access for graphical output, manipulating video memory directly to render game graphics, which involved drawing pixels and lines on the screen for game elements like bricks, ball, and paddle.
Optimized performance through low-level system programming, achieving seamless frame rates and responsive controls.
Employed debugging and testing in a low-level development environment, ensuring the stability and reliability of game functions.
Wrote custom procedures for graphical rendering and user input handling using keyboard interrupts, contributing to the game's ability to process user commands in real time.
Integrated a color-based feature for differentiating between various sections of the paddle, which influenced the ball's trajectory, adding a strategic component to the game.
Technologies Used: x86 Assembly, DOSBox Emulator, VGA graphics programming.
