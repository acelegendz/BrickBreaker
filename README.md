This is a bricks breaker game, I used Intel Assembly to build this game. To compile and run it on Dosbox
Use commands TASM bricks,
              Tlink bricks util_br,
              bricks
User can press 1 or 2 affter reaching 50 points, once per game, that can entend the paddle and shoot a laser out of the paddle repectively.
